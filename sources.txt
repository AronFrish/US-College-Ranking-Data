All data was generated during April of 2023.

Sources :
 - Acceptance Rates : US News (using 2022 acceptance rates)
 - Undergraduate Population : US News (using 2022 data) 
 - Niche Grades : Niche (pulled from the Niche report card)
 - Nobel Prizes : uses data from https://www.bestmastersprograms.org/most-nobel-prize-winners/
 - Average SAT : uses US News, averaging the 25th and 75th percentiles of SAT.  There is no official average SAT standardized across all colleges, so I felt this was the most accurate source/method
 - Logos : I pulled these images from Wikipedia, pulling the coat of arms for each university
